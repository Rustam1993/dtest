PART 1:
    Create a container environment using Docker Compose to serve a static page grabbed from the host’s disk.
    Set up the containers to serve the page.
    Setup a provisioner-managed database server in the container.
    Add a statistics page in the scripted language of your choice. Loading a page will grab information about the database server (existing databases and users, you can create those manually).
    All containers have to be in one Docker compose file.
    Push your code to the private repo in the Github repo.
    Manually create necessary services in Azure in the cloud provider.
    Deploy your application to a cloud provider.

PART 2:

    Automate infrastructure setup for the Azure services you created manually to a cloud provider using infrastructure as code tool Terraform.
    You can keep your Terraform code alongside with your application in terraform/ folder.
    Push changes into your private repo.
